#WebScraper
This webscraper scrapes an online shopping site for the price of a gpu. If the price has dropepd it sends me gmail to notifie me.



The first script gmail_stuff.py sends a Gmail when it is either monday or the price of the GPU has dropped.

The second script web_scraping.py scrapes the website for the price of the GPU.

The third script main.py imports the two other files and calls the fuctions in the scripts.
